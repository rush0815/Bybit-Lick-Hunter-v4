Lick Hunter v4 is a full rewrite of LickHunter using some of the skills I have learned in the past two years and fully async compatable in Node JS. I have also released all of the source code in hope that if other users want to contribute to the project or add new features it is avaialable to them.

*Using a VPS can ensure high uptime and is much more stable than running on your own PC*

### Quick Linux Setup Steps:
*run each of these one at a time in the terminal, and wait for each to complete*

```
apt install npm
```

```
npm install n -g
```

```
n stable
```


```
apt install gh
```

```
git clone https://github.com/CryptoGnome/Bybit-Lick-Hunter-v4.git
```

```
cd Bybit-Lick-Hunter-v4
```

```
npm install

```
npm install node-cron
```

```
npm install sqlite3
```

```
cp example.env .env

*edit .env to the setup you wish to run you can learn more about the settings int the next section below*

```
sudo npm install pm2 -g 
```

```
pm2 start app.js
```

```
pm2 monit

*Using pm2 will allow the bot to catch restarts and run after you close the server, if you are familiar with linux and would prefer to use screen you could also do that.*
